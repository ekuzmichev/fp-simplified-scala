### Algebra is two things:

1) a SET of objects (not “objects” as in object-oriented)
2) the OPERATIONS used on those objects to create new objects from that set

With pure functions, you can never have two different return values for the same input value(s). This can’t happen with
pure functions, and it can’t happen with algebra, either.

“Algebraic” refers to the property that an Algebraic Data Type is created by “algebraic” operations. The “algebra” here
is “sums” and “products” (of types).

Pure Functions + Immutable Values == Algebra
