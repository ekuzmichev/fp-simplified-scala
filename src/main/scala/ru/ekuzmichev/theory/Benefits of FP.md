### Benefits of FP

- Pure functions are easier to reason about
- Testing is easier, and pure functions lend themselves well to techniques like property-based testing
- Debugging is easier
- Programs are more bulletproof
- Programs are written at a higher level, and are therefore easier to comprehend
- Function signatures are more meaningful
- Parallel/concurrent programming is easier

### Benefits of FP in Scala
- Being able to (a) treat functions as values and (b) use anonymous functions makes code more concise, and still readable
- Scala syntax generally makes function signatures easy to read
- The Scala collectionsâ€™ classes have a very functional API
- Scala runs on the JVM, so you can still use the wealth of JVM-based libraries and tools with your Scala/FP applications
