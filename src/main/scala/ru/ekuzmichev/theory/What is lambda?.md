### What is lambda?

Back in the 1930s, Alonzo Church was studying mathematics at Princeton University and
began using the Greek symbol λ — “lambda” — to describe ideas he had about these things called functions.

In modern functional programming, **lambda** means **“anonymous function.”**

Lambda calculus (also written as λ-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic
for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution

So we have:

- lambda means “anonymous function,” and
- calculus means “a formal system”

Therefore, the term **lambda calculus** refers to “a formal way to think about functions.”

It forms the basis of almost all functional programming languages today. 
Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus

The letter λ itself is arbitrary and has no special meaning.
(A better name would be a 'make'-function)

Lambda calculus introduced the concept of passing a function to a function
